# TODO Execution Rules

## Workflow for Executing TODO Items

When working with TODO lists (TODO.md files), always follow this execution workflow:

1. **Execute the specified task**
2. **Implement this task in THE SIMPLEST WAY POSSIBLE**
3. **Run the quality checks**:
    -   format
    -   test
    -   lint
4. **Ask for review and WAIT FOR APPROVAL**
5. **Mark the TODO item as complete with [X]**
6. **Commit the change to Git** (observing rules/git-rules.md) when approved

## Key Principles

-   Always implement the simplest solution that meets requirements
-   Never proceed to the next task without explicit approval
-   All quality checks must pass before requesting review
-   Wait for user review before marking items complete
-   Follow git commit rules when making changes
